void main(int argc, char *argv[]){

// Read in data

// Build the structs based on the data. Probably 1 struct per ticker name

// Find NASDAQ or S&P500 or something and keep that separate so that you can use it as the market baseline

// Pass 50 days of market baseline as well as the 50 corresponding days of your specific stock to a decision making function

// Recieve an ALPHA value from the decision making function. Store the alpha value and toss EVERYTHING ELSE to conserve memory. Maybe keep a count of how many alpha values are stored (for the purpose of averages)

// Compute the average alpha value

// Jump off a building when you see average alpha value
